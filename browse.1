.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm browse
is a simple terminal-based interface for browsing and selecting
files and directories.
These are its two only features; unlike its alternatives, it is not
a file manager.

When invoked,
.Nm browse
opens the current working directory, from which the user can browse
other directories as well.

.Nm browse
can be exited in two ways:
.Bl -enum
.It
The user cancels.
The program returns 1.
.It
The user selects a file or directory, whose path is printed on the
standard output.  The program returns 0.
.El
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm browse
is designed to be used not as a standalone program, but as an
extension to the shell, for the purpose of comfortably changing the
current working directory or for providing arguments to a shell
command.

For example, the following POSIX function launches
.Nm browse
and switches to the selected directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bg() {
	dir=$(browse) && cd "$dir"
}
.Ed

This function is included in the 
.Ql browse.sh
file.
The mneumonic is
.Dq browse & go (to) .
In addition, the placement on a QWERTY keyboard of
.Ql bg
is analogous to that of
.Ql cd .

Shells that support in-place execution of commands via a key binding, like
.Xr bash 1
and
.Xr mksh 1 ,
can use
.Nm browse
to pick files and directories to be inserted as arguments to their
shell commands.
The following
.Xr mksh 1
command maps ^T for this purpose:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind -m ^G='^[ browse^[^E'
.Ed

Now, when the terminal user presses ^G,
.Nm browse
will be opened.
When a selection has been made, its path will be inserted
into the line that the user was typing before invoking
.Nm browse .
